# Loans & Credit

---

## How Loans Work

1. **Apply** — Player submits a loan application at a bank
2. **Review** — Loan is auto-approved (score 700+) or requires banker approval
3. **Disbursement** — Approved amount is deposited into the player's account
4. **Repayment** — Player makes payments before the term ends
5. **Completion** — Loan marked as paid, credit score improves
